# E-Commerce-Sales-Forecast
#E-commerce retail sales are sales of goods and services where orders are placed and prices are negotiated over electronic networks, primarily the internet and now mobile device. I became interested in this topic as ecommerce has been changing the way people shop in the last decade with the rise of internet. In major consumer markets such as China and USA, e-commerce has taken over consumer transactions. For instance, this year Alibaba’s Singles’ Day smashes record with $25B of sales. In USA, share of e-commerce sales in total retail sales accounts for 9.1% in the third quarter of 2017. Amazon is the biggest e-commerce retailer; 70% of revenues comes from online sales. I decided to use this project as an opportunity to study the trend of e-commerce retail sales in US and make forecasts.
